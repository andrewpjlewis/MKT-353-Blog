This week we did a case study, looking at building a business built around snowboarding or chess. I learned some valuable skills using Google AdWord to see statistics about keyword searches. I think this is a super useful tool and one that I cannot wait to use in the future when creating more businesses. Another thing that has really stood out to me is that there is not always one correct answer. When going through the case study, I was supposed to decide whether we should choose the product first or the business model. I realized that either way you do it, you can succeed. One way may be a little bit better than the other depending on what you prefer, but it seems very objective to me. This is true in life as well. Life is not always black and white, and the best answer is often a mix of the two or just what makes you happy.",
